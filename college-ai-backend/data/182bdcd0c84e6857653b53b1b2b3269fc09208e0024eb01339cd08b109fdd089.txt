UNIT II SET THEORY The concept of a set is used in various disciplines and particularly in com puters. Basic Definition: 1. “A collection of w ell defined objects is called a set”. The capitals letters are used to denote sets and small letters are used for denote objects of the set. Any object in the set is called element or member of the set. If x is an element of the set X, then we write to be read as ‘x belongs to X’ , and if x is not an element of X, the we write to be read as ‘ x does not belo ngs to X’. 2. The number of elements in the set A is called cardinality of the set A, denoted by |A| or n(A) . We note that in any set the elements are distinct. The collection of sets is also a set. Here itself one set and it is one element of S and |S|=4. 3. Let A and B be any two s ets. If every element of A is an elem ent of B, then A is called a subset of B is denote by We can say that A contained (included) in B, (or) B contains (includes) A. Symbolically, (or) Logically, Basic concepts of Set theory - Laws of Set theory - Partition of set, Relations - Types of Relations: Equivalence relation, Partial ordering relation - Graphs of relation - Hasse diagram, Functions: Injective, Surjective, Bijective functions, Compositions of functions, Identity and Inverse functions.

For any sets A, B and C (Refl exive) (Transitive) Note that does not imply except for the following case. 4. Two sets A and B are said to be equal if and only if and Example and then Since and eventhough The equality of sets is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 5. A set A is said to be a proper subset of a set B if and Symbolically it is written as is also called a proper inclusion. 6. A set is said to be universal set if it includes every set under our discussion. A universal set is denoted by or E. In other words, if p(x) is a predicate. One can observe that universal set contains all the sets. 7. A set is said to be empty set or null set if it does not contain any elem ent, which id denoted by SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 3In other words, if p(x) is a predicate. One can observe that null set is a subset for all sets. 8. For a set A, the set of all subsets of A is called the power set of A. The power set of A is denoted by Example, Let Then Then set and A are called improper subsets of A and the rem aining sets are called proper subsets of A. One can easily note that the number of elements of SOME OP ERATIONS ON SET S 1. Intersection of sets Definition: Let A and B be any two sets, the intersection of A and B is written as is the set of all elements which belong to both A and B. Symbolically Example then . From the definition of intersection it follows that for any sets A,B,C and universal set E. 2. Disjoint sets SATHYABAMA UNIVERSITY,DISCRETE MATHEMATICS & NUMERICAL METHODS, SMT1203, UNIT 2 SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 4Definition: Two set A and B are called disjoint if and only if , that is, A and B have no element in common. Example A and B are disjoint and B and C also, but A and C are not disjoint. 3. Mutua lly disjoint sets Definition: A collection of sets is called a disjoint collection, if for every pair of sets in the collection, are disjoint. The elements of a disjoint collection are said to be mutually disjoint. Let be an indexed set, A is mutually disjoint if and only if for all Example Then is a disjoint collection of sets. and 4. Unions of sets Definition: The union of two sets A and B, written as , is the set of all elements which are el ements of A or the elements of B or both. Symbolically Example Let then From the union, it is clear that, for any sets A, B,C, and universal set E. SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 5. Relative complement of a set Definition: Let A and B are any two sets. The relative complement of B in A, written the set of elements of A which are not elements of B. Symbolically Note that Example Let then It is clear fr om the definition that, for any set A and B. 6. Complement of a set Definition: Let A be any set, and E be universal. The relative complement of A in E is called absolute complement or complement of A. The complement of A is denoted by (or Symbolically SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II Example Let be uni versal set and be any set in E.

RELA TIONS Binary relation Any set of ordered pairs defines a binary relation. SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 18If x and y are binary related, under the relation R, the we write If not t he case we write 1. Example Then F, L are binary relations. 2.Example Let A and B be any two sets, then any non empty subset R of is called a binary relation. Now then Let Then and are b inary relations A to B. Let S be any binary relation. The domain of S is the set of all elements x such that for some Similarly, the range of S is the set of all elements y such that, for some Let SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II then clearly and In case of then the relation defined on is called an universal relation in X. then a relation on is called void relation in X. Since re lations are sets, then we can have their union and intersection and so on. Properties of B inary relations 1. Reflexive Let R be a binary relation defined on X. Then R is reflexive if, for ev ery Example: Let and are defined on X. SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 20Then R is reflexive, but S is not reflexive. Since and 2. Symmetric A relation R from X to Y is symmetric if every and , whenever then That is, if , then R is symmetric Example: Let and are defined on X. Then R is symmetric, but S is not symmetric. Since but 3. Transitive A relation R is transitive if, whenever and then That is, if , then R is transitive. Example: Let and Then R is transitive, but S is not transitive. Since and but 4.Irreflexive A relation R in a set X is irreflexive if, for every SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 21Example: Let and Then R is irreflexive, but S i s not reflexive. Since and 5. Antisymmetric A relation R in a set X is antisymmetric if, whenever and then That is, if , then R is antisymmetric. Example: Let X be the set of all subsets of E. R be t he inclusion relation defined on X. Therefore R is antisymmetric in X. 6. Relation matrix Let are ordered sets, R be a relation defined from X to Y, then the relation matrix of R, is defined as Example 1: Let SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II be a relation from X to Y. Then Example 2: Let be a relation on Then 7. Composition of Binary Relations The concept of composition of relation is different from union and intersection of two relations. Definition: Let R be a relation from X to Y and S be a relation from Y to Z. Then the composite is a relation from X to Z defin ed by The operation is called “ composition of relations”. Example. Let . Then Note that etc., SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 23Definition: The relation matrix for is given by where is defined as follows. where ) is 1 if and only if row i of and column j of have a 1 in the same relative position k, for some k. Example: Let . Then SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II Definition Let R be a relation from X to Y. The converse of R, is written as , is a relation from Y to X such that SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 25Example: Also it is clear that Result: The relation matrix is the transpose of the relation Example: Let We have SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II EQU IVALEN CE RELA TION Definition: A relation R on a set X is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Example 1: Let and is an equivalence relation on X. Example 2: Equality of subsets on a universal set is an equi vance relation. Example 3: Let Now, is divisible by 3. Therefore (reflexive) For any Let is divisible by 3 we have is also divisible by 3. (symmetric) Let SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II is divisible by 3 an d is divisible by 3. ) is divisible by 3. is divisible by 3. Therefore (Transitive) Therefore R is an equivalence relation on X. EQU IVALEN CE CLASSES Definition: Let R be an equivalence relation on a set X. For any the set given by is called an R-equivalence class generated by Therefore, an equivalence class is the set of all elements which are rel ated to x by an equivalence relation R on X. Example: Let Z be the set of all integers and R be the relation called “congruence modulo 4” defined by (or Now, we determine the equivalence classes generated by R. Note that SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II Therefore In a similar manner, we get the equivalence classed generated by the relation “congruence modulo m” for any integer m. Therefore, an equivalence re lation R on X, will divide the set X into an equivalence classes, and they are called portion of X. PARTIAL OR DERED RELA TION A relation R on a set X is said to be a partial ordered relation, if R sati sfies reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Example: Let be the power set of a set A. Define a subset relation , then is a partial ordered relation. Usually we denote the partial ordered relations as is said to be partially ordered set (or) poset, which is denoted by . We will study more about posets in the subsequent sections. 1. Closures of a re lation Let R be a relation on the set X. 2. Reflexive closure We have the relation R is reflexive if and only if the relation. is contained in R. i.e. R is reflexive Definition: SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 29Let R be a relation on X, then the smallest reflexive relation on X, containing R, is called reflexive closure of R. Therefore is the reflexive closure of R. 3. Symmetric closure We have, the relation R is sym metric if Definition: Let R be a relation X, then smallest symmetric relation on X, containing R, is called the symmetric closure of R. Therefore is the symmetric of R. 4. Transitive closure We have, the relation R is transitive, if then Definition: A relation is said to be the transitive closure of the relation R on X if the smallest transitive relation on X, containing R, i.e is the transitive closure of R, if II. is transitive on X III. There is no transitive relation on X, such that Remarks: 1. The transitive closure of R can be obtained by SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 2. We know that if and only if there is an element y such that and Therefore if and only if we can find a sequence in X such that are all in R. The sequence is said to be a chain of length n from a to b in R. Here are called interval vertices of the chain in R. Note that the interval vertices need not be distinct. PROBLEM S 1.

Since, in R, we have , then check any other pair starting with then we must have i.e., but there is no pair staring with 1. So, pass on to next pair then we check any other pair starting with 2, and so on. In T, we have , then there are two pairs and must be the transitive of , then we must have and in T. Then pass to the transitive pairs are and then we must have the pairs in T. Then pass to , find the transitive pairs of and so on, for all pairs in T. Hence T is a transitive relation.

SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II 8 12 4 6 2 3 SATHYABAMA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS-SMTA1302, UNIT II FUNCTIONS A function in set theory world is simply a mapping of some (or all) elements from Set A to some (or all) elements in Set B. In the example above, the collection of all the possible elements in A is known as the domain ; while the elements in A that act as inputs are specially named arguments . On the right, the collection of all possible outputs (also known as “range” in other branches), is referred to as the codomain ; while the collection of actual output elements in B mapped from A is known as the image. Types of Functions 1. Injective (One -to-One) Functions: A function in which one element of Domain Set is connected to one element of Co -Domain Set. 2. Surjective (Onto) Functions: A function in which every element of Co - Domain Set has one pre-image. Example: Consider, A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {a, b, c} and f = {(1, b), (2, a), (3, c), (4, c)}. It is a Surjective Function, as every element of B is the image of some A Note : In an Onto Function, Range is equal to Co -Domain. 3. Bijective (One -to-One Onto) Functions: A function which is both injective (one to - one) and surjective (onto) is called bijective (One -to-One Onto) Function. Example: 1. Consider P = {x, y, z} 2. Q = {a, b, c} 3. and f: P → Q such that 4. f = {(x, a), (y, b), (z, c)} The f is a one -to-one function and also it is onto. So it is a bijective function. 4. Into Functions: A function in which there must be an element of co -domain Y does not have a pre -image in domain X. Example: 1. Consid er, A = {a, b, c} 2. B = {1, 2, 3, 4} and f: A → B such that 3. f = {(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)} 4. In the function f, the range i.e., {1, 2, 3} ≠ co- domain of Y i.e., {1, 2, 3, 4} Therefore, it is an into function 5. One -One Into Functions: Let f: X → Y. The function f is called one -one into function if different elements of X have different unique images of Y. Example: 1. Consider, X = {k, l, m} 2. Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} and f: X → Y such that 3. f = {(k, 1), (l, 3), (m, 4)} The function f is a one -one into function 6. Many -One Functions: Let f: X → Y. The function f is said to be many -one functions if there exist two or more than two different elements in X having the same image in Y. Example: 1. Consider X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 2. Y = {x, y, z} and f: X → Y such that 3. f = {(1, x), (2, x), (3, x), (4, y), (5, z)} The function f is a many -one function Example 1: Test whether the function f:R →R, f(x) = |x| + x is one -one onto function Solution: (1) Given f(x) = |x| + x f(3) = |3|+3 = 6 f(-3) = | -3|+(-3) = 0 f(2) = |2|+2= 4 f(-2) = | -2|+(-2) = 0 f(-3) = f( -2) = 0 0 has more than one pre -image. Thus f(x) is not 1 -1 function (2) The range of f is the set of non -negative real numbers.  f is not onto function Example 2: Let S = {x, x2/ xN} and T ={(x,2x)/x N } where N ={1,2….}. Find the range of S and T. Find S T and ST Solution: S = {x, x2/ xN} S = {(1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,16), ………} T = {(x,2x) /xN } S = {(1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,8), ………} Range of S = {1, 4, 9, ………………………} Range of T = {1, 4, 6, 8, …………………..} ST = {(1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,16), (1,2), (3,6), (4,8), ………} ST = {(2,4)} Example 3: If f: R→R, g: R→R are defined by f(x) = x2-2, g(x) = x+4, find (fog) and (gof) and check whether these functions are injective, surjective and bijective Solution: fog(x) = f[g(x)] = f(x+4) =(x+4)2-2 = x2+8x+14 ----------------- (1) gof(x) = g[f(x)] = g(x2-2) = x2+2--------------------------------- (2) Given f: R →R g: R→R f(x) = x2-2 (1) f(1) = 11-2 = -1 f(-1) = ( -1)2-2 = -1 i.e., f(x 1) = f(x 2) does not imply x 1 = x 2 Hence f is not 1 -1 function (2) Let f: R→R Let yR. Suppose x R such that f(x) = y x2-2 = y x2 = y+2 x =y+2 f(y+2) = (y+2)2-2=y+2 -2 = y for any yR There exist at least one element y+2R such that f(y+2)=y  f is on to function g(x) = x+4 (1) g(x 1) = g(x 2) x1+4 = x 2+4 x1 = x 2 g is 1 -1 function (2) g: R→R Let y R. Suppose x R suc h that f(x) = y x = y -4 for any y R There exist at least one element y -4R such that g(y-4) = y  g is on to function As f is not 1 -1 but onto, f is not bijective As g is 1 -1 and onto, g is bijective Theorem 1 : A function f:A→B has an inverse if and only if it is bijective. Proof. Suppose g is an inverse for f (we are proving the implication ⇒). Since g∘f=IA, g∘f=IA is injective, so is f . Since f∘g=i B, f∘g=i B is surjective, so is f. Therefore f is injective and surjective, that is, bijective. Conversely, suppose f is bijective. Let g:B→A , g:B→A be a pseudo -inverse to f. since ff is surjective, f∘g=i B, f∘g=i B, and since f is injective, g∘f=iA, g∘f=iA. Theorem 2: Let A and B be nonempty sets, and suppose f : A → B is invertible. Then f −1 : B → A is also invertible, and (f −1 ) −1 = f. Proof . f −1 is invertible if there is a function g : A → B that satisfies g ◦ f −1 = IB and f −1 ◦ g = I A; and in that case the function g is the unique inverse of f −1 . Since g = f is such a function, it follows that f −1 is invertible and f is its inverse. Theorem 3: If f:A→B has an inverse function then the inverse is unique. Proof. Suppose g1 and g2 are both inverses to f. Then g1=g1∘IB=g1∘(f∘g2)=(g 1∘f)∘g2=IA∘g2=g2,g1=g1∘IB=g1∘(f∘g2)=(g 1∘f)∘g2=IA∘g2=g2, proving the theorem Theorem 4 : If f : A → B and g : B → C are one -one, then gof : A → C is also one-one. Proof: A function f : A → B is defined to be one-one, if the images of distinct elements of A under f are distinct, i.e. for every x 1, x2 ∈ A, f(x 1) = f (x 2) implies x 1 = x 2. Given that f: A → B and g: B → C are one -one. For any x 1, x2 ∈ A f(x1)=f(x 2) ⇒ x1=x2 …(i) g(x 1)=g(x 2) ⇒ x1=x2 …(ii) To show: If gof(x 1) = gof(x 2), then x 1 = x 2 Let gof(x 1) = gof(x 2) ⇒ g[f(x 1)] = g[f(x 2)] ⇒ f(x1) = f(x 2) …from (i) ⇒ x1 = x 2 …from (ii) Hence, the functions gof: A → C are one -one. Theorem 5: If f : A → B and g : B → C are onto, then gof : A → C is also onto. Proof: Let us consider an arbitrary element z ∈ C '.' g is onto ∃ a pre -image y of z under the function g such that g (y) = z ………(i) Also, f is onto, and hence, for y Î B, there exists an element x ∈ A such that f (x) = y ……(ii) Therefore, gof (x) = g (f (x)) = g (y) from (ii) = z from (i) Thus, corresponding to any element z ∈ C, there exists an element x ∈ A such that gof (x) = z. Hence, gof is onto. Note: In general, i f gof is one -one, then f is one -one. Similarly, if gof is onto, then g is onto. The composition of functions can be considered for n number of functions. Theorem 6: If f : X → Y, g : Y → Z and h : Z → S are functions, then ho(gof ) = (hog) o f. Proof: Let x ∈ A LHS: ho(gof ) (x) = h(gof(x)) = h(g(f(x))), ∀ x in X RHS: (hog) of f(x) = hog(f(x)) = h(g(f (x))), ∀ x in X. LHS = RHS Hence, ho(gof) = (hog)of. The composition of functions satisfies the associative property. Theorem 7: Let f : X → Y and g : Y → Z be two invertible functions. Then gof is also invertible with (gof)–1 = f –1og–1 Proof: Given that f: A → B and g: B → C are bijective. Then gof :A → C is also bijective. Therefore (gof)–1 :C → A exists. Also f-1: B→A and g-1: C→B exists. Therefore f –1og–1 :C → A exists. Also we know that f ◦ f −1 = IB and f −1 ◦ f = I A g ◦ g −1 = Ic and g −1 ◦ g = I B Consider (f –1og–1 ) o (gof) = (f –1o(g–1og)of) = (f –1o(IBof)) = IA Also (gof) o(f –1og–1 ) = (go(f of –1 )og–1 ) = (go(I Bog–1 )) =IA Hence, (gof)–1 = f –1og–1.

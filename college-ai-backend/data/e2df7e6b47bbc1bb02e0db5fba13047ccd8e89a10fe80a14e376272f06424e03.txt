To find : n( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶 ∪ 𝐷) We know that n(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶 ∪ 𝐷) = n(𝐴) + n( 𝐵) + n( 𝐶 )+ n(𝐷) − n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) − n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐶 )− n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐷) − n( 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 )− n(𝐵 ∩ 𝐷 )− n( 𝐶 ∩ 𝐷) + n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 )+ n( 𝐴 ∩ B ∩ 𝐷) + n(𝐴 ∩ C ∩ 𝐷) + n(𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 ∩ 𝐷) − n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 ∩ 𝐷) n (A) = [ ] = 333 n (B) = [ ] = 200 n (C) = [ ] = 142 n (D) = [ ] =45 n (A ∩𝐵) = [ ] = 66 n (A ∩𝐶) = [ ] = 47 n (A ∩𝐷) = [ ] = 15 n (B∩𝐶) = [ ] =28 n (B ∩𝐷) = [ ] =9 n (C ∩𝐷) = [ ] =6 n (A ∩B∩𝐶) = [ ] = 9 n (A ∩B∩𝐷) = [ ] =3 n (A ∩C∩𝐷) = [ ] =2 n (B ∩C∩𝐷) = [ ] = 1 n (A ∩B∩𝐶 ∩𝐷) = [ ] =0 By the principle of Inclusion - Exclusion, the number of integers between 1 and 1000 that are divisible by at least one of 3, 5, 7 and 22 is given by n(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶 ∪ 𝐷) = n(𝐴) + n( 𝐵) + n( 𝐶 )+ n(𝐷) − n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) − n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐶 )− n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐷) − n( 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 )− n(𝐵 ∩ 𝐷 )− n( 𝐶 ∩ 𝐷) + n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 )+ n( 𝐴 ∩ B ∩ 𝐷) + n(𝐴 ∩ C ∩ 𝐷) + n(𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 ∩ 𝐷) − n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶 ∩ 𝐷) = (333 + 200 + 142 + 45) − (66 + 28 + 47 + 15 + 9 + 6) + (9 + 3 + 2 + 1) − 0 = 720 − 171 + 15 – 0 = 564 ∴ n (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶 ∪ 𝐷 )= 564 . Number of integers between 1 and 1000 that are not divisible by any of the integers 3, 5, 7 and 22 = Total – n ( A ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶 ∪ 𝐷) = 1000 − 564 = 436 . 4.

Solution: Let A, B, C be the sets of integers that lie between 1 and 1000 and that are divisible by 5, 7 and 9 respectively. To find : n ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶 ) n(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶) = n( 𝐴 ) + n( 𝐵) + n( 𝐶) − n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) − n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐶) − n( 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) + n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) n (A) = [ ] = 200 n (B) = [ ] = 142 n (C) = [ ] = 111 n (A ∩𝐵) = [ ] =28 n (A ∩𝐶) = [ ] = 22 n (B ∩𝐶) = [ ] = 15 n (A ∩B∩𝐶) = [ ] = 3 The number of integers divisible by 5, 7 and 9 is n(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶) = n( 𝐴) + n( 𝐵) + n( 𝐶) − n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) − n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐶) − n( 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) + n( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) = (200 + 142 + 111) − (28 + 22 + 15) + 3 = 391. ∴ n (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶) = 391 . Hence, the number of integers not divisible by 5, nor by 7, nor by 9 = Total – n (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ )= 1000 − 391 = 609 . 5.

Hence, the number of integers not divisible by 5, nor by 7, nor by 9 = Total −n ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶 )= 300 − 154 = 14 6. 7. There are 250 students in an engineering college.

Total number of let ters = 11 Number of times ‗M‘ occur = 2 Number of times ‗T‘ occur = 2 Number of times ‗A‘ occur = 2 ∴ Total number of ways the letters are arranged = 11! 2!2!2! = 4989600 ways. M, A, T are the letter that could be placed in the beginning and ending. Suppose M‘s are the ends, (i.e., beginning and ending) then the other 9 -places are to be filled up with 2- A‘s, 2 -T‘s, 1 -H, 1-E, 1-I, 1-C, 1- S. ∴Number of ways this can be done = 9! 2!2!1!1!1!1! = 9! 2!2! Similarly, If A‘s are the ends , then number of ways this can be done = 9! 2!2! If T‘s are the ends , then number of ways this can be done = 9! 2!2! ∴ The total number of arrangements = 9! 2!2! + 9! 2!2! + 9! 2!2! = 272160 ways. 10.

Generalised Pigeonhole Principle : Statement: If m pigeons are assigned to n pigeonholes, then there must be a pigeonhole containing at [ 𝑚−1 ] +1 pigeons 𝑛 Problems: 1. If 9 colors are used to paint 100 houses, such that at least 12 houses will be the same color. Solution: Number of Pigeons, m= Number of Houses=100 Number of Pigeonholes, n= Number of colors=9 By Generalized Pigeonhole principle, No. of houses having same color=[ 𝑚 −1 ]+ 1 = [100−1 ]+ 1 = 12 𝑛 9 Hence at least 12 houses will have the same color. 2. If we select any group of 1000 students on campus. Show that at least three of them must have same birthday. Solution: Number of Pigeons, m= Number of students=1000 Number of Pigeonholes, n= Number of days in a year=366 days By Generalized Pigeonhole principle, Number of students having same birthday=[𝑚 −1 ]+ 1 = [1000 −1 ]+ 1 = 3 𝑛 366 Hence at least 3 students will have the same birthday. 3. What is the maximum number of students required in a class to be sure that atleast 6 will receive the same grade, if there are five possible grades A,B,C,D,F. Solution: Number of Pigeons , m= Number of students=? Number of Pigeonholes, n= Number of possible grades=5 Given : At least 6 will receive the same grade. By Generalized Pigeonhole principle, ⇒[ 𝑚 −1 ] + 1 = 6 ⇒ 𝑚 − 1 + 5 = 30 ⇒ 𝑚 = 26 5 Thus, minimum no. of students needed to ensure that atleast 6 students will receive the same grade is 26. 4. State and prove pigeon hole principle. (or) If n+1 pigeonholes are occupied by m pigeons, , prove that at least one pigeonhole is occupied by more than one pigeons. Solution: Number of Pigeons =n+1 Number of Pigeonholes =n To prove: At least one Pigeonhole is occupied by more than one pigeon. Assume that, if at least one pigeonhole is not occupied by more than one pigeon. ⇒Each pigeonhole contains exactly one pigeon. So n pigeonhole contain n pigeons Which is a contradiction because there are n+1 pigeons Hence our assumption is wrong. x………………………………………………………………….x

UNIT - IV Topic : 1 Algebraic Structures 1)Define Binary Operation with Example: Let A be any non-empty sets. The binary operation ∗ is a function from A x A i.e. a rule which assigns to every pair (a, b) ∈ A x A, a unique element a∗b ∈ A. Example: Usual addition, multiplication are binary operation defined on the set of real numbers. Matrix addition and Matrix multiplication are binary operation on the set of 2 x 2 real matrices. 2) Define Algebraic System with Example: A non-empty set A together with one or more n-ary operations ∗ defined on it, is called an algebraic system or algebraic structure or Algebra. We denote it by (A, ∗) Note: +, –, ∙ , x, ∗ , ∪, ∩ etc.., are some of binary operations. Properties of Binary operations: Let the binary operation be ∗ : A x A → A. Then we have the following properties 1) Closure Property: a ∗ b ∈ A for all a, b ∈ A. 2) Associativity: (a ∗ b) ∗ c = a ∗ (b ∗ c) for all a, b, c ∈ A. 3) Identity element: a ∗ e = e ∗ a = a, for all a ∈ A, where e is called the identity element. 4) Inverse element: If a ∗ b = b ∗ a = e, then b is called the inverse of a and it is denoted by a–1, (i.e. b= a–1). 5) Commutative: a ∗ b=b ∗ a for all a, b ∈ A. 6) Distributive properties: for all a, b, c ∈ A. (i) a∗ (b ∙ c) = (a ∗ b) ∙(a∗c) [Left distributive law] (ii) (b ∙ c) ∗ a = (b ∗ a) ∙ (c∗ a) [Right distributive law] 7) Cancellation properties: for all a, b, c ∈ A (i) a ∗ b = a ∗ c ⇒ b = c [Left cancellation law] (ii) b ∗ a = c ∗ a ⇒ b = c [Right cancellation law] Note: If the binary operations defined on G is + and x, then we have the following table Properties For all a, b, c ∈ (G, +) For all a, b, c ∈ (G, x) 1. Closure a+b ∈ G a x b ∈ G 2. Associativity (a + b)+ c =a + (b + c) (a x b) x c =a x (b x c) 3. Identity element a+0=0+a=a, Here 0 is Additive Identity a x 1=1 x a=a, Here 1 is Multiplicative Identity 4. Inverse element a+(–a) = 0, Here (–a) is Additive inverse 1 1 a x = x a=1, Here a a 1 is multiplicative inverse 5. Commutative a + b=b + a a x b=b x a Notation: ℤ or 𝑰 The set of all integer. ℚ The set of all rational number. ℝ The set of all real number. ℝ⁺ The set of all positive real number. ℚ⁺ The set of all positive rational number. ℂ The set of all complex number. Example 1: The set of integers ℤ with the binary operations + and x is an algebraic system since it satisfies all the above properties. Example 2: The set of real numbers ℝ with binary operations + and x is an algebraic system. 3) Define Semi group with Example: Definition: If a non-empty set S together with the binary operation ∗ satisfying the following two properties. (a) Closure property (b) Associative property is called a semigroup. It is denoted by (S, ∗). Example: 1. Let X be any non-empty set. Then the set of all functions from X to X is the set Xx , is a semigroup w.r.to ∗, the composition of functions. 2. (I, +), (I, ×) are semigroups, where + is the usual addition and × is the usual multiplication. 3. (P(A), ∩) and (P(A), ∪) are semigroups. Where P(A) is the powerset of A (the set of all subsets of A). 4. N= {0, 1, 2 …} then (N, +), (N, x) are semigroups. N is not a semigroup w.r.to the operation subtraction. Solved Examples: 1. Show that the set of all natural numbers N is a semigroup w.r.to operation ∗ defined by a ∗ b = max {a, b}. Solution: N is closed under the operation ∗ . For a, b, c ∈N a ∗ (b ∗ c) = max {a, max {b, c}} = max {a, b, c} (1) (a ∗b)∗c = max{max {a, b}, c} (a ∗b)∗c = max {a, b, c} (2) From (1) and (2), (a ∗ b) ∗ c =a ∗ (b ∗ c), ∀ a, b, c ∈ N ∴ ∗ is associative. ∴ (N, ∗) is a semigroup. 2. Show that the set of rational numbers Q is a semigroup for the operation ∗ defined by a ∗ b = a + b – ab. Solution: Q is closed for ∗ . a ∗ (b ∗ c) = a ∗ (b + c – bc) = a + b + c – bc – a (b + c – bc) = a + b + c – ab – bc – ca + abc (1) (a ∗ b) ∗ c = (a + b – ab) ∗ c = a + b – ab + c – (a + b – ab) c = a + b + c – ab –ac – bc + abc (2) From (1) and (2), (a ∗ b) ∗ c =a ∗ (b ∗ c), ∀ a, b, c ∈ Q ∴ ∗ is associative. ∴ (Q, ∗) is a semigroup. 3. Show that the set of rational numbers Q is a semigroup for operation ∗ defined by a ∗ b = a b 2 ∀ a, b ∈ Q Solution: Q is closed for ∗. a ∗ (b ∗ c) = a ∗ 𝑏𝑐 2 = 𝑎𝑏𝑐 (a ∗ b) ∗ c = 𝑎 𝑏 2 ∗ c =𝑎𝑏𝑐 (a ∗ b) ∗ c =a ∗ (b ∗ c), ∀ a, b, c ∈ Q ∴ ∗ is associative. ∴ (Q, ∗) is a semigroup. 4. Let (A,∗ ) be a semigroup. Show that for a, b, c in A if a ∗ c = c ∗ a and then b ∗ c = c ∗ b then (a ∗ b) ∗ c = c ∗ (a * b). Solution: L.H.S. (a ∗ b) ∗ c = a ∗ (b ∗ c) [ ∵ ∗ is associative] = a ∗ (c ∗ b) [ ∵ b ∗ c = c ∗ b] =(a ∗ c) ∗ b [ ∵ ∗ is associative] = (c ∗ a) ∗ b [ ∵ a ∗ c = c ∗ a] = c ∗ (a * b) [ ∵ ∗ is associative] =R.H.S. 5. Let (S, ∗) be а commutative semigroup. If х ∗ х = х, у ∗ у = y, prove that (x ∗ y) ∗ (x ∗ y) = x ∗ y. Solution: L.H.S.: (x ∗ y) ∗ (x ∗ y) =x ∗ (y ∗ (x ∗ y)) =x ∗ ((y ∗ x) ∗ y) = x ∗ ((x ∗ y) ∗ y) = x ∗ (x ∗ (y ∗ y)) = x ∗ (x ∗ y) = (x ∗ x) ∗ y = x ∗ y = R.H.S. 6. Let (S, ∗) be а commutative semigroup. If х ∗ х = х, у ∗ у = y, prove that (x ∗ y) ∗ (x ∗ y) = x ∗ y. Solution: L.H.S.: (x ∗ y) ∗ (x ∗ y) =x ∗ (y ∗ (x ∗ y)) =x ∗ ((y ∗ x) ∗ y) = x ∗ ((x ∗ y) ∗ y) = x ∗ (x ∗ (y ∗ y)) = x ∗ (x ∗ y) = (x ∗ x) ∗ y = x ∗ y = R.H.S. 7. Let {{х, у} , ∙ } be а semigroup where x ∙ x = у. Show that (i) x ∙ y = y ∙ x (ii) y ∙ y=y. Solution: (i) x ∙ (x ∙ x) = (x ∙ x) ∙ x (Since ∙ is associative) Given х ∙ х = у ∴ x ∙ y = y ∙ x (ii)То ргоvе: y ∙ y=y Since the set {х, у} is closed for operation ‘∙’, x ∙ y = x (or) x ∙ y = y Assume x ∙ y = x y ∙ y= y ∙ (x ∙ x) = (y ∙ x) ∙ x = (x ∙ y) ∙ x ∴ y ∙ y= y Next consider the case x ∙ y = y, y ∙ y= (x ∙ x) ∙ y = x ∙ (x ∙ y) ∴ y ∙ y= y 8. Let (A, ∗) be a semi group. Further more for every a,b ∈ A, if a ≠ b then a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a (i) Show that for every a ∈ A, a ∗ a = a (ii) For every a ∈ A, a ∗ (b ∗ a) = a. (iii) For every a, b, c ∈ A, (a ∗ b) ∗ c = a ∗ c. Solution: (i) a ∗ (b ∗ c) = (a ∗b)∗c Put b = a and c=a a ∗ (a ∗ a) = (a ∗a)∗a Since (A, ∗) is not commutative, a ∗ a = a. (ii ) Let us assume that b ∈ A then we have for b ∈ A, b ∗ b = b. Let a ∗ (b ∗ b) = a ∗b [ ∵b ∗ b = b ] (a ∗ b) ∗ b = a ∗b [ ∵ associative] Hence a ∗ b = a (1) (Using Right Cancellation law) ∴ a ∗ (b ∗ a) = (a ∗b)∗a From [ ∵ associative] = a ∗ a = a (iii ) (a ∗ b) ∗ c = a ∗ c [ ∵ a ∗ b = a] x………………………………………………………………………………..x Monoids 1)Define Monoid with Example: A semigroup (S, ∗) with an identity element w.r.t. ‘ ∗’ is called Monoid. It is denoted by (M, ∗). In other words, a non-empty set 'M' with respect to ∗ is said to be a monoid, if ∗ satisfies the following properties. (a) Closure property (b) Associative property (c) Identity property Examples: 1. N= {0, 1, 2 …} then (N, +), (N, x) are monoids. 2. (Z, x), (Z, +) are monoids. 3. The set of even integers E= {……, −4, −2,0,2,4, … . }, Then (E, +) is a monoid and (E, x) is a semigroup but not a monoid. 4. (P(A), ∪) is a monoid with identity element ∅. (P(A), ∩) is a monoid with identity element A, where A is any set. Problem: 2) Show that the set of integers, is a monoid for the operation ∗ defined by a∗b=a+b−ab, for a, b ∈ I. Solution: I is closed for the operation ∗ . Further ∗ is a associative. The element 0 ∈ I is the identity Element Since x ∗ 0 = x + 0 – x ∙ 0 = x and 0 ∗ x = 0 + x − 0 ∙ x = x, ∀ x ∈ I. ∴ (I,∗ ) is a monoid with identity 0 ∈ I. x……………………………………………………………………..x Topic 2: GROUPS 1) Define Group with Example : A non-empty set G with binary operation ∗ is called a group if the following axioms are satisfied. 1. ∗ is associative, i.e.(a ∗b)∗c= a ∗ b ∗ c ∀ a, b, c ∈ G. 2. There exists an element e ∈ G such that a ∗ e = e ∗ a = a, ∀ a ∈ G. (e is the identity element). 3. For every a ∈ G, ∃ an element a-1∈ G, such that a ∗ a-1 =a−1 ∗ a = e. (a -1 is called the inverse element of a). 2)Define Abelian Group (or) Commutative Group A group (G, ∗) is called abelian if a ∗b=b∗a, ∀a, b ∈ G. i.e. ∗ is commutative in G. Example: 1. (I, +) is a group called the additive group of integers. 2. M2 (R), the set of all 2 x 2 matrices is a group w.r.to matrix addition. 3. The set of all non-singular 2 x 2 matrices is a group w.r.to matrix multiplication. 4. The set of nth roots of unity {1, w, w2, ......, wn-1} is a group w.r.to the operation multiplication of complex numbers. 5. G= {1, -1, i, -i}. In G, the operation ‘∙ ’ is defined by the following table. Then (G, ∙ ) is an abelian group. ∙ 1 -1 i -i 1 1 -1 i -i -1 -1 1 -i I i i -i -1 1 -i -i i 1 -1 Here ‘ ∙ ’ is the multiplication of complex numbers. Examples : 1. Show that [Z 5 , +5] is an abelian group. Solution: The table for addition modulo 5 is. (i) Closure property: [a] +5 [b]= remainder when the sum is divided by 5. (ii) Associative Property: From the table for [a], [b], [c] ∈ Z5 [a] +5 ([b] +5 [c]) = ([a] + 5 [b]) +5 [c] (iii ) Identity: [0] ∈ Z5 is the identity (iv ) Inverse: The inverse of [1] is [4]. The inverse of [2] is [3]. The inverse of [3] is [2]. The inverse of [4] is [1]. The element [0] ∈ Z5 has self-inverse. (v ) Commutative property: Further [a] +5 [b] = [b] +5 [a],∀ [a], [b] ∈ Z5. ∴ (Z5, +5) is an abelian group. +5 [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [0] [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [0] [2] [2] [3] [4] [0] [1] [3] [3] [4] [0] [1] [2] [4] [4] [0] [1] [2] [3] 2. Show that [{1,2, 3, 4}, x 5] is an abelian group. Solution: The table for the x 5 is as follows Z 5 = {1,2,3,4} and x 5 is multiplication operation ×5 1 2 3 4 1 1 2 3 4 2 2 4 1 3 3 3 1 4 2 4 4 3 2 1 (i) Closure Property: Here a ∈ Z5 means a = [a] a x 5 b = remainder when ab is divisible by 5. (ii) Associative Property: For a, b, c ∈ Z5. a x 5 (b x5 c) = (a x 5 b) x5 c (iii) Identity: 1 ∈ Z5; is the identity element. (iv) Inverse: The inverse of 1 is 1 The inverse of 2 is 3 The inverse of 3 is 2 The inverse of4 is 4 (v) Commutative property: Further a x 5 b=b x 5 a, ∀ a, b ∈ Z5. ∴ [{1,2, 3, 4}, x 5] is an abelian group. x………………………………………………………….x Topic :3 Properties of Group Property 1: The identity element in a group is unique. Proof: If (G, ∗ ) be a group and e 1 and e 2 be two identity elements of G. Let x ∈ G; x∗ e1 = x and x ∗ e2 = x ∴ x∗e1= x∗ e2, By using left cancellation law, we get e 1 = e2 ∴ Identity element is unique Property 2: The inverse of every element in a group is unique. Proof: Let (G, ∗ ) be a group, with identity element e. Let b and c be inverses of a element a ∈ G. a ∗ b=b ∗ a = e a ∗ c=c ∗ a = e b =b ∗ e =b ∗ (a ∗ c) = (b ∗ a) ∗ c = e ∗ c b = c Property 3: If a is an element in a group (G, ∗) then (a-1)-1 = a. Property 4:( Reversal law) If a and b are two elements in a group (G, ∗) then (a ∗ b)-1 = b-1 ∗ a-1. [ prove (a ∗ b) ∗ (b-1 ∗ a-1) = e and (b-1 ∗ a-1) ∗ (a ∗ b) = e] Property 5: Cancellation laws In a group (G, ∗), for every a, b, c ∈ G, then (i) a∗ c = b ∗ c implies a=b (Right Cancellation law) (ii) c∗ a = c∗ b implies a=b (Left Cancellation law) Property 6: In a group (G, ∗), the equations x ∗ a=b and a ∗ y=b has unique solution. Proof: Consider x ∗ a=b Post multiplying by a-1 x ∗ (a ∗ a-1) = b∗ a-1 i.e. x ∗ e = b ∗ a-1 ∴ x = b ∗ a-1 Proof of Uniqueness Let x1 and x 2 be two solutions of x ∗ a= b. Then x 1 ∗ a= b and x 2 ∗ a= b. ∴ x1 ∗ a = x 2 ∗ a ⇒ x1 = x2 [By Right cancellation law] ∴ The solution is unique. In a similar manner, the equation a ∗ y=b has a solution y = a-1 ∗ b and it has unique solution. Examples 1. Show that a group (G, ∗ ) is abelian iff (a ∗ b)2= a2 ∗ b2 Solution: First we assume that (G, ∗ ) is abelian, (a∗ b)2=(a ∗ b) ∗ (a∗ b) =a∗ (b ∗ (a ∗ b)) =a∗ ((b ∗ a)∗ b) Since G is abelian, a ∗ b=b ∗ a. ∴ (a ∗ b)2= a ∗ ((a ∗ b) ∗ b) = (a ∗ a) ∗ (b ∗ b) = a2 ∗ b2 Conversely, we assume that (a ∗ b)2= a2 ∗ b2. To prove : G is abelian (a ∗ b)2=a2∗ b2 (a ∗ b) ∗ (a ∗ b) = (a ∗ a) ∗ (b ∗ b) a ∗ (b ∗ (a ∗ b)) = a ∗ (a ∗ (b ∗ b)) b ∗ (a ∗ b) = a ∗ (b ∗ b) [by Left cancellation law] (b ∗ a) ∗ b = (a ∗ b) ∗ b b ∗ a = a ∗ b [by Right cancellation law] ∴ a ∗ b = b ∗ a, ∀ a, b ∈ G ∴ G is abelian. 2. Show that (G, ∗ ) is abelian iff (a ∗ b)-1 = a-1 ∗ b-1. Solution: Assume that G is Abelian. ∴(a ∗ b) = (b ∗ a),∀ a,b ∈ G (a ∗ b)-1= (b ∗ a)-1 =a-1 ∗ b-1 Conversely assume (a ∗ b)-1 = a-1 ∗ b-1 But a-1 ∗ b-1 = (b ∗ a)-1 (By Reversal law) ∴ (a ∗ b)-1= (b ∗ a)-1 From given Taking inverses both sides, ((a ∗ b)-1)-1 = ((b ∗ a)-1)-1 ⇒ a ∗ b = b ∗ a, ∀ a, b ∈ G ∴ (G, ∗) is abelian 3. Show that if every element in a group is its own inverse, then the group is abelian. Solution: Let G be a group such that every element in G is its own inverse. ∴ For a ∈ G, a-1=a Let a, b ∈ G, then (a ∗ b) ∈ G and so (a ∗ b)-1 =a ∗ b (1) But (a ∗ b)-1 = b-1 ∗ a-1 Since b-1 = b, a-1 = a. ⇒ (a ∗ b)-1 = b ∗ a (2) From (1) and (2) we have a ∗ b = b ∗ a ∀ a, b ∈ G ∴ G is abelian. 4. Prove that if for every element a in a group (G, ∗), a2 = e then G is an abelian group. Solution: Let a, b ∈ G Then (a ∗ b) ∈ G and so (a ∗ b)2 = e (1) Since a ∈ G, a2=e ⇒ a ∗ a = e b ∈ G, b2=e ⇒ b ∗ b = e From (1) (a ∗ b)2 = e ⇒ (a ∗ b) ∗ (a ∗ b) = e ∗ e = (a ∗ a) ∗ (b ∗ b) a ∗ (b ∗ (a ∗ b)) = a ∗ (a ∗ (b ∗ b)) b ∗ (a ∗ b) = a ∗ (b ∗ b) [by Left cancellation law] i.e. (b ∗ a) ∗ b = (a ∗ b) ∗ b ∴b ∗ a =a ∗ b [by Right cancellation law] ∴ G is abelian. x……………………………………………………………………………x  4 2 5 3 1 Topic 4: Symmetric Groups (S n) 1) Define Permutation with Example: A permutation of a set A is a one- to-one and onto function from set A to itself. Example. : If A={1,2,3,4,5}, then a permutation is function σ where: σ (1)=4, σ (2)=2, σ (3)=5, σ(4)=3, σ (5)=1. This can be represented with permutation notation as:   1 2 3 4 5 2) Define Symmetric Set: If S is a finite set having n distinct elements then we shall have n! distinct permutations of the sets. The set of all distinct permutations of degree n defined on the set S is denoted by S n called symmetric set of permutations of degree n. Note: O(Sn)=n!. Problems: 1. List all elements of the symmetric set S 3, where S={1,2,3} and prove that (S 3, °) is a non abelian group. Solution: Given S={1,2,3}. Total number of permutation on S=3!=6. Elements of symmetrical set S 3= {P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6} where 𝑝 = ( ) , 𝑝 = ( 𝑝 = ( ) , 𝑝 = ( 𝑝 = ( ) , 𝑝 = ( The operation ’°‘ product of permutations defined on the set S3={P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6} is given in the table.  1 2 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 5 5 4 6 6 ° P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P1 P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P2 P2 P1 P4 P3 P6 P5 P3 P3 P5 P1 P6 P4 P2 P4 P4 P6 P2 P5 P1 P3 P5 P5 P3 P6 P1 P4 P2 P6 P6 P4 P5 P2 P3 P1 To prove: (S 3, °) is a non abelian group. (i) Closure: Since the body of the table contains only the elements of S 3.  (S3, °) is closed. (ii) Associativity: We know composition of function S 3 is associative and so it is true in S 3 also. (S 3, °) is associative. P1 P3 P3 P4   P1 P4  P3 P6  P6 .

Let 𝑒 be the identity element in 𝐺 and let 𝐻 ⊆ 𝐺. If 𝐻 itself is a group with the same operation ∗ and the same identity element 𝑒. (or) Let , ∗ be a group and 𝐻 ⊆ 𝐺. 𝐻, ∗ is called a subgroup of 𝐺, ∗ , if 𝐻 itself is a group with respect to ∗. Example: (𝑄, +) is a subgroup of (𝑅, +) . 2)Define TRIVIAL SUBGROUP OR IMPROPER SUBGROUP Solution: For any group 𝐺, ∗ , { 𝑒 , ∗+ and 𝐺, ∗ are subgroups, called trivial subgroups. 3)Define NON TRIVIAL SUBGROUP OR PROPER SUBGROUP Solution: All other subgroups other than { , ∗+ and (𝐺, ∗) are called non trivial subgroup. 4)What is the CONDITION FOR A NON-EMPTY SUBSET H to be subgroup of G 𝐻,∗ is said to be a subgroup of 𝐺, ∗ if (i). 𝐻 is closed for the operation ∗, ∀ 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻. (ii). 𝐻 contains the identity element 𝑒 (i.e) 𝑒 ∈ 𝐻 where 𝑒 is the identity of 𝐺. (iii). For any 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐻. Topic 6 : Theorems on Subgroups 1)Theorem 1: State and Prove NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITION For a subgroup : Statement : A non-empty subset 𝐻 of a group 𝐺, ∗ is a subgroup of 𝐺 if and only if 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻 for all 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻. PROOF: Necessary Condition: Let 𝐻 be a subgroup of a group 𝐺 and 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻. To prove: 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻. Since 𝐻 is a subgroup and 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑏−1 must exist and 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻. Now, 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻. [By closure property] Sufficient Condition: Assume 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻. To prove: 𝐻 be a subgroup of a group 𝐺. (i). IDENTITY : Now, 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑒 ∈ 𝐻. Hence the identity element, 𝑒 ∈ 𝐻. (ii). INVERSE: 𝑒 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑒 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐻. ⇒ Every element ′𝑎′ of 𝐻 has its inverse 𝑎−1 is in 𝐻. (iii). CLOSURE: If 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 then 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻. 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ (𝑏−1 )−1 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻. (iv). ASSOCIATIVE: Now 𝐻 ⊆ 𝐺 and the associative law hold good for 𝐺, as 𝐺 is a group. Hence it is true for the element of 𝐻. Thus all axioms for a group are satisfied for 𝐻. Hence 𝐻 is subgroup of 𝐺. 2)Prove : The intersection of two subgroups of a group 𝐺, ∗ is also a subgroup of (𝐺, ∗) & The Union need not be a Subgroup . PROOF: Let 𝐻 and 𝐾 are subgroups of (𝐺, ∗) To prove that: 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 is subgroup of (𝐺, ∗) . We have 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 ≠ ∅. [∵ atleast identity element is common to both 𝐻 and 𝐾]. Let 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 ⇒ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 and 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻 ∩K ⇒ 𝑎 ∈H and 𝑎 ∈ 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ K⇒ 𝑏 ∈H and 𝑏 ∈ Now, 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻 [𝐻 is a subgroup , Theorem 1], 𝑎 ∈ 𝐾, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐾 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐾 [𝐾 is a subgroup , Theorem 1]. Therefore, 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾. Thus 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 and 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾. 𝐻 ∩ 𝐾 is a subgroup of 𝐺. [By Theorem 1] ALSO, The union of two subgroups need not be a subgroup. Example : Let (𝑍, +) is a group. Let 𝐻 and 𝐾 are subgroup of (𝑍, +) where 𝐻 ={ … . −4, −2,0,2,4,6 … . } = {0, ±2, ±4, ±6. . } 𝐾 = {… . −6, −3,0,3,6,9 … . } = {0, ±3, ±6, ±9. . } 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 = {0, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±9. . } 3, 8 ∈ 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 but 3 + 8 = 11 ∉ 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾. Therefore, 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 is not closed with respect to addition. Therefore, 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 is not a subgroup of 𝐺. 3)Prove: The union of two subgroups of a group 𝐺 iff one is contained in the other. PROOF: Assume 𝐻 and 𝐾 are subgroups of 𝐺 and 𝐻 ⊆ 𝐾 or 𝐾 ⊆ 𝐻. To prove that. 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 is a subgroup. ∵ 𝐻 and 𝐾 are subgroups and 𝐻 ⊆ 𝐾 ⟹ 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 = 𝐾. (or) 𝐻 and 𝐾 are subgroups and 𝐾 ⊆ 𝐻 ⟹ 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 =𝐻. Therefore, 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 is a subgroup. Conversely, Suppose 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 is a subgroup. To prove that, one is contained in the other (i.e) 𝐻 ⊆ 𝐾 or 𝐾 ⊆ 𝐻. Suppose, 𝐻 ⊈ 𝐾 or 𝐾 ⊈ 𝐻. Then, ∃ elements 𝑎, such that a ∈ 𝐻 and 𝑎 ∉ 𝐾 -------------------- (1) b∈ K and 𝑏 ∉ 𝐻 ------------------- (2) Clearly, 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾. Since, 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾 is a subgroup of 𝐺, 𝑎𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 ∪ 𝐾. Hence, 𝑎𝑏 ∈ 𝐻 or 𝑎𝑏 ∈ 𝐾. Case 1: Let 𝑎𝑏 ∈ 𝐻. ∵ a ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐻. Hence, 𝑎−1 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻, which is a contradiction (2). Case 2: Let 𝑎𝑏 ∈ 𝐾. ∵ 𝑏 ∈ 𝐾, 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐾. Hence, 𝑏−1 𝑎𝑏 = 𝑎 ∈ 𝐾, which is a contradiction (1). Therefore, Our assumption is wrong. Thus, 𝐻 ⊆ 𝐾 or 𝐾 ⊆ 𝐻. PROBLEMS: 1. Find all the non-trivial subgroup of (𝑍6, +6).

Definition : A subgroup (𝐻, ∗) of (𝐺, ∗) is called normal subgroup of G 𝑖𝑓 𝑎𝐻 = 𝐻𝑎 , ∀ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺. 2) Theorem: Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal Proof : Let (𝐺,∗) be a abelian group and (𝐻,∗) be a subgroup of G. Let 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 be any element. Then 𝑎𝐻 = {𝑎 ∗ 𝑕 /𝑕 ∈ } = {𝑕 ∗ 𝑎 /𝑕 ∈ 𝐻} (since G is abelian) = Ha Since 𝑎 is arbitrary, 𝑎𝐻 = 𝐻𝑎 ∀ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 Therefore H is a normal subgroup of G. 3) Theorem: (𝑁,∗) is a normal subgroup of (𝐺,∗) iff 𝑎 ∗ 𝑛 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝑁 ∀ 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁 and ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐺. Proof : Let (𝑁,∗) is a normal subgroup of (𝐺,∗). Therefore 𝑎𝑁 = 𝑁𝑎 ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎−1 = 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑎−1 = 𝑁 ∗ 𝑒 = 𝑁 Therefore for any 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁, 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝑁 Conversely, if 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝑁, 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁, ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐺, To prove 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 = 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎 Let 𝑥 ∈ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 ⇒ x = a ∗ n for some 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁 x = a * n * e ⇒ x= a * n *( a-1 * a) ⇒ x = a ∗ n ∗ a−1 ∗ a ∈ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 ⊆ 𝐍 ∗ 𝑎 ......................................................................(1) Let 𝑦 ∈ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎 ⇒ y = n ∗ a for some 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁 Then 𝑦 = 𝑎 ∗ a−1 ∗ n ∗ a = a ∗ (a−1 ∗ n ∗ a−1 −1) ∈ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 Therefore 𝑦 ∈ 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎 ⇒ y ∈ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑁 therefore 𝑁 ∗ 𝑎 ⊆ a ∗ 𝑁 ..................

To Prove (𝑁1 ∩ 𝑁2 , ∗ ) is a normal subgroup of (𝐺, ∗). 𝑎 ∗ 𝑛 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝑁1 ∩ 𝑁2 (by previous theorem) Since 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 are normal subgroup of G, they are basically subgroups. We know 1 ∩ 𝑁2 is a subgroup of G. Now we shall prove it is a normal subgroup of G. Let n ∈ 𝑁1 ∩ 𝑁2 be any element and 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 be any element Then n ∈ 𝑁1 and n ∈ 𝑁2, Since N 1 and N 2 are normal, 𝑎 ∗ 𝑛 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝑁1 and 𝑎 ∗ 𝑛 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝑁2, Therefore 𝑎 ∗ 𝑛 ∗ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝑁1 ∩ 𝑁2 .

A mapping 𝑔: 𝐺 → 𝐺1 is called group homomorphism if 𝑔 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏 = 𝑔 𝑎 ∘ 𝑔 𝑏 for all 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺. 2) Properties of group homomorphism: A group homomorphism preserves identities, inverses and sub groups. Theorem 1: Homomorphism preserves identities. (or) If ( ) = 𝑒1 where 𝑒 and 𝑒1 are the identity elements of 𝐺 and 𝐺1 respectively. Proof: Let 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺, If 𝑒 is the identity element 𝐺, then 𝑎 ∗ 𝑒 = 𝑒 ∗ 𝑎 = 𝑎 ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎 ∗ 𝑒) = 𝑓 𝑎 ⇒ f (a) ∘ f(e) = 𝑓 (𝑎) ∵ 𝑓 is homomorphism ⇒ 𝑓 ( e) = 𝑒1 ∴ 𝑓 preserves identities. Theorem 2: Homomorphism preserves inverse (or) 𝑓 (𝑎−1 )= [ 𝑓( 𝑎)]−1 Proof: Let 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺, 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐺 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑎−1 = 𝑎−1 ∗ 𝑎 = 𝑒 Since 𝑎 ∗ 𝑎−1 = 𝑒 ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎 ∗ 𝑎−1 )= 𝑓 (𝑒 ) ⇒ f (𝑎) ∘ f (a −1 ) = f ( 𝑒1) ∵ 𝑓 is homomorphism ∴ 𝑓 (𝑎−1 )= [𝑓 (𝑎)] −1. ∴ 𝑓 preserves inverse Theorem 3: Homomorphism preserves subgroup (or) If 𝐻 is a subgroup of ,then 𝑓 (𝐻) is a subgroup of 𝐺1. Proof: Let H be a subgroup of G ⇒ for 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻 [∵ 𝐻 is a subgroup] Let 𝑓 (𝑎) ∈ 𝑓( 𝐻) and 𝑓 (𝑏) ∈ 𝑓(H) . To prove 𝑓 (𝑎) ∘ 𝑓 (𝑏 −1) ∈ 𝑓 ( H) Consider f (a) ∘ f( 𝑏 −1 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ) ∈ 𝑓 (𝐻) [∵ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐻] ⇒ f (a) ∘ f ( 𝑏 −1 ) ∈ 𝑓 (𝐻) ∀ 𝑓 (𝑎) ∈ 𝑓 (𝐻) and𝑓 (𝑏) ∈ 𝑓( 𝐻) . ∴ 𝑓 ( H) ⊆ 𝐺1 is a subgroup of 𝐺1. Theorem 4: Let 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ be a group homomorphism and 𝐻 is a subgroup of 𝐺′ . Then 𝑓−1 ( )is a subgroup of 𝐺. Proof: Clearly 𝑓−1 (𝐻) is a non empty subset of 𝐺 [∵ 𝐻 is a subgroup of 𝐺.] Now let us consider 𝑎 = 𝑓−1 (𝑐) ∈ 𝑓−1 (𝐻) and b = 𝑓−1 (𝑑) ∈ 𝑓−1 (H) . For 𝑐, 𝑑 ∈ 𝐻 with 𝑓 (a ) = 𝑐 and 𝑓( 𝑏) = 𝑑. Let a, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑓−1 (H) ⇒ 𝑓 ( a ), f (b) ∈ 𝐻 [∵ 𝐻 is a subgroup.] ⇒ 𝑓 (a ) ∗ 𝑓 (𝑏 −1 )∈ 𝐻 ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎 ∗ b −1 )∈ 𝐻 [∵ 𝑓 is homomorphism.] ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝑓−1 ( H ) ∴ a, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑓−1 (𝐻) ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝑓−1 (𝐻) Hence 𝑓−1 (𝐻) is a subgroup of 𝐺1. x……………………………………………….x Topic 9: KERNEL OF A HOMOMORPHISM: 1)Define KERNEL OF A HOMOMORPHISM with Example: Let 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ be a group homomorphism. The set of elements of G which are mapped into 𝑒′ (identity element in 𝐺′) is called the kernel of 𝑓 and it is denoted by ker f . ker 𝑓 = {𝑥 ∈ 𝐺/𝑓( 𝑥) = 𝑒′ } , 𝑒′ is identity of 𝐺′ . then ker 𝑓 = {𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐} Example: 1. 𝑓: (𝑍, +) → (𝑍, +) defined by 𝑓 (𝑥) = 2𝑥 then ker 𝑓 = {0} 2. :( 𝑅∗,∙) → (𝑅+,∙) defined by 𝑓 (𝑥) = |𝑥|, then ker 𝑓 = *1, −1+ . 2) If 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ is a homomorphism then ker 𝑓 = { 𝑒} iff 𝑓 is 1- 1. Proof: Assume 𝑓 is one to one Then f ( e ) = 𝑒′ ∴ ker 𝑓 = { 𝑒} Conversely, Assume ker 𝑓 = { 𝑒} Now 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑓 ( ) ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑥)* f(𝑦−1 )= f (y) * f(𝑦−1 ) ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑥𝑦−1 )= 𝑒′ ⇒ 𝑥𝑦−1 ∈ ker 𝑓 ⇒ 𝑥𝑦-1 = 𝑒 ⇒ 𝑥 = 𝑦 ∴ 𝑓 ( 𝑥) = 𝑓 (𝑦) ⇒ 𝑥 = 𝑦 Hence f is one to one. 3) Prove that Kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G. Proof: Let ( 𝐺,∗) and (𝐺′ ,∙) be the groups and 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ is a group homomorphism. By the definition of homomorphism, f(𝑎 ∗ 𝑏) =f (a) . 𝑓 (𝑏 ) ∀𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺. By the definition of kernel, 𝐾 = {𝑎 ∈ 𝐺/ f( 𝑎) = 𝑒′+ i.e., 𝑓 ( )= 𝑒′ ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐾 and 𝑒′ is the identity element of H. To prove that ‘K’ is a normal subgroup of G. i.e., To prove i) 𝐾 is nonempty ii) 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐾, ∀𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐾 iii) 𝑥 ∗ 𝑕 ∗ 𝑥−1 ∈ 𝐾, ∀ 𝑕 ∈ 𝐾 , 𝑥 ∈ 𝐺 i) Identity element ‘ 𝑒’ of G is mapped to identity element of e’ of G’. i.e., 𝑓 (𝑒) = 𝑒′ ∴ 𝑒 ∈ 𝐾 ⟹ 𝐾 is non-empty. ii) Let 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐾 ⊆ 𝐺 ⟹ 𝑓 (𝑎) = 𝑓 (𝑏) = 𝑒′ 𝑓 (𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 )= 𝑓 (𝑎) . f(𝑏−1) {∵ 𝑓 is homomorphism} = 𝑒′ . (𝑒′)−1 = 𝑒′ . 𝑒′ = 𝑒′ ∴ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐾. Hence K = ker f is a subgroup iii) Let 𝑥 ∈ 𝐺 and 𝑕 ∈ 𝐾 be any element. ⟹ 𝑓 (𝑕) = 𝑒′ 𝑓 (𝑥 ∗ 𝑕 ∗ 𝑥−1 )= 𝑓 (𝑥 )∙ 𝑓 (𝑕) ∙ 𝑓( 𝑥−1 ) = 𝑓 (𝑥) ∙ 𝑒′ ∙ 𝑓 (𝑥−1 )= 𝑓 (x) ∙ 𝑓 (𝑥−1 )= 𝑒’ ∴ 𝑥 ∗ 𝑕 ∗ 𝑥−1 ∈ 𝐾 Hence K = ker f is a normal subgroup of G. x…………………………………………….x Topic : 10 Fundamental Theorem Of Group Homomorphism State and prove the Fundamental Theorem Of Group Homomorphism. Statement: Let (𝐺,∗) and (𝐺′ , ∙) be two groups. Let 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ be a homomorphism of groups with kernel K, then 𝐺 /𝐾 is isomorphic to (𝐺). i.e., 𝐺/𝐾 ≅ 𝐺′ Proof: Given that 𝑓: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ be a homomorphism of groups with kernel K. Define the map ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑎) =f (a) , ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 i) ∅ is well defined : Let 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺 such that 𝐾 ∗ 𝑎 = 𝐾 ∗ 𝑏 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐾 --------  (1) ⇒ f (a∗ 𝑏−1 ) = 𝑒′ {∵ 𝐾 is kernel} ⇒ f (a) ∗ f(𝑏−1 ) = 𝑒′ {∵ 𝑓 is homomorphism} ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎) ∗ f(𝑏)−1 ∗ 𝑓( 𝑏) = 𝑒′ ∗ 𝑓(𝑏) ⇒ f (a) = f( 𝑏) ⇒ ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑎) = ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑏) ∴ ∅ is well defined. ii) ∅ is one to one : To prove that ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑎) = ∅ (𝐾 ∗ )⇒ 𝐾 ∗ 𝑎 = 𝐾 ∗ 𝑏 We know that ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑎) = ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑏) ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎) = f(𝑏) ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎) ∗ f(𝑏−1 )= 𝑓 (𝑏) ∗ f(𝑏−1 ) = 𝑓 (𝑏 ∗ 𝑏−1 ) = 𝑓 (𝑒) ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎) ∗ f(𝑏−1 )= 𝑒′ ⇒ 𝑓 (𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 )= 𝑒′ ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏−1 ∈ 𝐾 ⇒ 𝐾 ∗ 𝑎 = 𝐾 ∗ 𝑏 ∴ ∅ is one to one. iii) ∅ is onto : Let 𝑦 ∈ 𝐺′ Since 𝑓 is onto, there exists 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 such that 𝑓 (a ) = 𝑦 ⇒ ∅ ( 𝐾 ∗ 𝑎) = 𝑦 {∵ 𝑓 (𝑎) = ∅(𝐾 ∗ 𝑎) } Thus every element of 𝐺′ has preimage in 𝐺/𝐾 ∴ ∅ is onto. i) ∅ is a homomorphism : ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑎 ∗ 𝐾 ∗ 𝑏) = ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑏) = 𝑓(𝑎 ∗ 𝑏) = 𝑓(𝑎) ∗ 𝑓( 𝑏) = ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑎) ∗ ∅ (𝐾 ∗ 𝑏) ∴ ∅ is a homomorphism. Since ∅ is one to one, onto and homomorphism, ∅ is isomorphism between 𝐺/𝐾 and 𝐺′ . ∴ 𝐺/𝐾 ≅ 𝐺′ 2) State and prove the Cayley’s representation theorem . (or) Prove that every finite group of order ‘n’ is isomorphic to a permutation group of order ‘n’. Proof: To prove the theorem, we have to show the following. a. To form a set 𝐺 of permutation b. To prove 𝐺′ is a group c. Exhibit an Isomorphism ∅: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ . a. To form a set 𝐺 of permutation: Let 𝐺 be a finite group of order ‘n’ and 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 be any element. Corresponding to ‘a’ we define a map 𝑓𝑎 (x) = 𝑎 ∗ 𝑥, ∀𝑥 ∈ 𝐺 then 𝑓 is one to one. ∵ 𝑓𝑎 (x) = 𝑓𝑎 (𝑦) ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑥 = 𝑎 ∗ 𝑦 ⇒ 𝑥 = 𝑦 (by left cancellation law) Now 𝑦 ∈ 𝐺 (Co-domain), then 𝑎−1 ∗ 𝑦 ∈ 𝐺 such that 𝑓𝑎 (𝑎−1 ∗ 𝑦) = 𝑎 ∗ (𝑎−1 ∗ 𝑦) = (𝑎 ∗ 𝑎−1 )∗ 𝑦 = 𝑒 ∗ 𝑦 = 𝑦 ∴ 𝑓𝑎 is onto. Thus 𝑓𝑎 is a one to one and onto function from 𝐺 → 𝐺 and so it is a permutation on b. To prove 𝐺′ is a group: Let , 𝑓𝑏 ∈ 𝐺′ be any two elements, then (𝑓𝑎 ∘ 𝑓𝑏 ) 𝑥 = 𝑓𝑎 (𝑓𝑏 (𝑥)) = 𝑓𝑎 (𝑏 ∗ 𝑥) = 𝑎 ∗( 𝑏 ∗ 𝑥) = (𝑎 ∗ 𝑏) ∗ 𝑥 = 𝑓𝑎∗𝑏 ∴ 𝐺′ is closed. Composition mapping is also associative. Since ‘e’ is the identity element of G, 𝑓𝑒 ∈ 𝐺′ is identity mapping. Let 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 ⟹ 𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐺 𝑓𝑎−1 𝑓𝑎 (𝑥) = 𝑓𝑎−1 (𝑎 ∗ 𝑥) = (𝑎−1 ∗ 𝑎) ∗ 𝑥 = 𝑒 ∗ 𝑥 = 𝑓𝑒 (𝑥) ∴ 𝑓𝑎−1 ∈ 𝐺′ Hence G’ is a group. c.Isomorphism ∅: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ : To prove 𝐺 and 𝐺′ are isomorphic. Let ∅: 𝐺 → 𝐺′ be defined by ∅ (𝑎) =fa , ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 Now for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, ∅ (𝑎 ∗ 𝑏) = 𝑓𝑎∗𝑏 = 𝑓𝑎 ∗ 𝑓𝑏 = ∅ (𝑎 )∅ (𝑏) ∴ ∅ is a homomorphism. Suppose ∅ (𝑎) = ∅ (𝑏) then 𝑓𝑎 = 𝑓𝑏 ⟹ 𝑓𝑎 (𝑥) = 𝑓𝑏 (𝑥) , ∀𝑥 ∈ 𝐺 ⟹ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑥 = 𝑏 ∗ 𝑥 ⟹ 𝑎 = 𝑏 {Right Cancellation law} ∴ ∅ is one to one Since Thus𝑓𝑎 is onto, ∅ is onto. G≅ 𝐺′ Topic 11: COSETS and LAGRANGE’S THEOREM: 1)Define cosets with Example: Definition : Let (𝐻,∗) be a subgroup of (𝐺,∗). Let 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺 be any element. Then 𝑎𝐻 = {𝑎 ∗ 𝑕 /𝑕 ∈ }is called the left coset of H in G determined by 𝑎. Sometimes 𝑎𝐻 can be written as 𝑎 ∗ 𝐻. The set 𝐻𝑎 ={ 𝑕 ∗ 𝑎 /𝑕 ∈ 𝐻} is called the right coset of H in G determined by 𝑎. Points to remember : 1. Since 𝑒 ∈ 𝐻, 𝑎 ∗ 𝑒 ∈ 𝑎𝐻 ⇒ 𝑎 ∈ 𝑎𝐻 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑒 ∗ 𝑎 = 𝑎 ∈ 𝐻𝑎 2. Also 𝑒𝐻 = 𝑒 ∗ 𝑕/𝑕 ∈ 𝐻 = 𝑕/𝑕 ∈ 𝐻 = 𝐻 and 𝐻𝑒 = 𝑕 ∗ 𝑒/𝑕 ∈ 𝐻 = 𝑕/𝑕 ∈ 𝐻 = 𝐻 So 𝐻 itself is a left coset as well as right coset. 3. In general, 𝑎𝐻 ≠ 𝐻𝑎. But if G is abelian, then 𝑎𝐻 = 𝐻𝑎 That is every left coset is a right coset. Problems: 1.Find the left cosets of 𝐻 = (5 𝑍, +) which is a subgroup of ( 𝑍, +) Solution: If 𝐻 = 5 𝑍 then (𝐻, +) is a subgroup of (Z , +). Then the distinct left cosets of 𝐻 in 𝑍 are 0 + 𝐻 = 𝐻 = 0 + 5𝑥 where ∈ 𝑍 1 + 𝐻 = 1 + 5 𝑥 where x ∈ 𝑍 2 + 𝐻 = 2 + 5 𝑥 where x ∈ 𝑍 3 + 𝐻 = 3 + 5 𝑥 where x ∈ 𝑍 4 + 𝐻 = 4 + 5 𝑥 where x ∈ 𝑍 5 + 𝐻 = 5 + 5 𝑥 where x ∈ 𝑍 = 5(1 + 𝑥) where 𝑥 ∈ 𝑍 = 𝐻 6 + 𝐻 = 6 + 5 𝑥/𝑥 ∈ 𝑍 = 1 + 5(1 + 𝑥) where 𝑥 ∈ 𝑍 = 1 + 𝐻 and so on. Therefore number of different left cosets of 𝐻 in 𝐺 is 5. 2)Theorem : Let (𝐻,∗) be a subgroup of (𝐺,∗). Then the set of all left cosets of 𝐻 in 𝐺 form a partition of 𝐺. Proof : Let 𝑎𝐻 and 𝑏𝐻 be any two left cosets. We shall prove either 𝑎𝐻 = 𝑏𝐻 (or) 𝑎𝐻 ∩ 𝑏𝐻 = ∅. Suppose 𝑎𝐻 ∩ 𝑏𝐻 ≠ ∅, then there exists an element 𝑥 ∈ 𝑎𝐻 ∩ 𝑏𝐻 ⇒ 𝑥 ∈ 𝑎𝐻 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥 ∈ 𝑏𝐻 ⇒ x= a ∗ 𝑕1 x= 𝑏 ∗ 𝑕2, 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑕1 , 𝑕2 ∈ 𝐻 ................................ (1) Therefore, 𝑎 ∗ 𝑕1 = 𝑏 ∗ 𝑕2, ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑕1 ∗ 𝑕−1 = 𝑏 ∗ 𝑕2 ∗ 𝑕−1 1 1 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ (𝑕1 ∗ 𝑕−1 ) = 𝑏 ∗ (𝑕2 ∗ 𝑕−1 ) 1 1 ⇒ 𝑎 ∗ 𝑒 = 𝑏 ∗ (𝑕2 ∗ 𝑕−1 ) a = 𝑏 ∗ (𝑕2 ∗ 𝑕−1 ) ........................ (2) If 𝑥 is any element in 𝑎𝐻, then 𝑥 = 𝑎 ∗ 𝑕 ⇒ 𝑥 = 𝑏 ∗ (𝑕2 ∗ 𝑕−1 )∗ 𝑕  x = 𝑏 ∗ ( 𝑕2 ∗ 𝑕−1) ∗ 𝑕 ∈ b𝐻 Therefore x ∈ 𝑎𝐻 ⇒ x ∈ 𝑏𝐻 therefore 𝑎𝐻 ⊆bH .......................... (2) Similarly we can prove 𝑏𝐻 ⊆ aH ........................................................ (3) From (2) and (3) we get 𝑎𝐻 = 𝑎𝐻. 𝑎∈𝐺 𝑎∈𝐺 Thus any two left cosets are either equal or disjoint. Further ∪𝑎𝐻 ⊆ 𝐆 since union of subsets is a subset.If 𝑥 is any element in G, then 𝑥 = 𝑥 ∗ 𝑒 ∈ 𝑥𝐻 Therefore 𝑥 is a left coset and hence 𝑥 ∈ ∪𝑎𝐻 . 𝐻𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 ⇒ 𝑥 ∈ 𝐺 ⇒ 𝑥 ∈ ∪ 𝑎∈𝐺 𝐺 ⊆ ∪ 𝑎∈𝐺 . Therefore 𝐺 = ∪ 𝑎∈𝐺 . Thus all the left cosets forms partition of G. 3) State and prove Lagrange’s theorem : Statement:The order of a subgroup 𝐻 of a finite group 𝐺 divides the order of the group. (i.e) order of 𝐻 divides order of 𝐺. Proof : Let (𝐺,∗) be a group of order n and (𝐻,∗) be a subgroup of order m. Since 𝐺 is a finite group, the number of left cosets of 𝐻 in 𝐺 is finite. Let r be the number of left cosets of 𝐻 in 𝐺 Let the r cosets be 𝑎1𝐻, 𝑎2𝐻 … . 𝑎𝑟 𝐻. We know that the left cosets of 𝐺 forms a partition of 𝐺. (by previous theorem) Therefore 𝐺 = 𝑎1𝐻 ∪ 𝑎2𝐻 ∪ … .∪ 𝑎 𝑟 𝐻 Therefore 𝑜 ( G) = o (𝑎1𝐻 ∪ 𝑎2𝐻 ∪ … .∪ 𝑎 𝑟 𝐻) = o ( 𝑎1𝐻) + 𝑜 (𝑎2 H) + ⋯o ( 𝑎𝑟 𝐻) But o(𝑎𝑖𝐻) = 𝑜 (𝐻) (by previous theorem) Therefore 𝑜 (𝐺) = 𝑜 (𝐻) + 𝑜 (𝐻) + ⋯ … o( 𝐻) 𝑟 times ⇒ 𝑜( 𝐺) = 𝑟 𝑜 (𝐻) Thus O (𝐻) divides 𝑜(𝐺) 𝑎𝐻 𝑎𝐻 ⇒ Topic 12: RINGS AND FIELDS 1)Define Ring with Example: Definition : A non-empty set R with two binary operations + and . called addition and multiplication is called ring if the following axioms are satisfied.

(vi) Also we can verify distributive law (vii) 𝑎 ×4 (𝑏+4𝑐 ) = 𝑎 ×4 𝑏 +4(𝑎 ×4 𝑐) 𝑏+4 ×4 𝑎 = 𝑏 ×4 𝑎 + (𝑐 ×4 𝑎) Hence (𝑍4 , +4,×4) is a commutative ring with unity. 3.

To prove F is an integral domain we have to show it has no zero divisors. Suppose 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐹 with 𝑎. 𝑏 = 0 let 𝑎 ≠ 0, since 𝑎 is a non zero element, its multiplicative invese exists (i.e) 𝑎−1exists . Therefore 𝑎−1. 𝑎. 𝑏 = 𝑎−1. 0 ⇒ 𝑎−1. 𝑎 . 𝑏 = 0 ⇒ 1. 𝑏 = 0 Thus 𝑎. 𝑏 = 0 ⇒ 𝑎 ≠ 0 ⇒ 𝑏 = 0 . Therefore F has no zero divisors. Hence (F,+, .) is an integral domain. 4) Show that ( z , +, . ) is an integral domain where 𝑍 is set of all integers. Proof : We know commutative ring with identity and without zero divisors is called integral domain. If 𝑍 is set of all integers, then (i) (𝑍, +) is an abelian group. (ii) (𝑍, ×) is a semi ring. (iii) 𝑎 × 𝑏 = 𝑏 × 𝑎 ∀𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 ∈ 𝑍 (iv) 𝑎 × 𝑏 + 𝑐 = 𝑎 × 𝑏 + 𝑎 × 𝑐 ∀𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 ∈ 𝑍 Hence ( z , +, . ) is a commutative ring with identity. If 𝑎 ≠ 0, 𝑏 ≠ 0 ∈ 𝑍 then we know 𝑎𝑏 ≠ 0. So 𝑍 is without zero divisors. Hence (z , +, . ) is an integral domain. X……………………………………….X
